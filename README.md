<div align="center">
  <p><strong>Hit the Bucket</strong> is a browser-based, front-end bucket list application built <strong>with React.</strong> Users can <strong><em>add</em></strong>, <strong><em>update</em></strong> or <strong><em>delete</em></strong> items from their bucket list, set an <strong><em>eagerness level for bucket list items</em></strong>, and find their list stored locally when they <strong><em>refresh or revisit the page</em></strong>.

  <p>The project was an assignment for the <a href="https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926"><strong>University of Birmingham Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>. This version of the project, however, was built after finishing the course - in order to consolidate my knowledge about/understanding of React. It was built with starter code - but most of the React logic itself is my own.</p>

## About
This project is based on a mini-project for the [University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926). It was a classroom project for Week 20, designed to put the fundamentals of React we had learned into practice.

## Key Features
The tech it uses includes:
- Multiple React components, a component tree
- State for storing an array
- Props, to pass through both the state object and functions that change state
- Event handling and forms
I think it will include more React features as I develop it futher - hopefully at least one hook (a useEffect hook), simple testing

## Version History
### 0.0.0 Starter Code
### 0.1.0 Add bucket item; render bucket items
Please take a look at the notes I made here, they are very detailed!
