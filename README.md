  <p><strong>Hit the Bucket</strong> is a browser-based, front-end bucket list application built <strong>with React.</strong> Users can <strong><em>add</em></strong>, <strong><em>update</em></strong> or <strong><em>delete</em></strong> items from their bucket list, set an <strong><em>eagerness level for bucket list items</em></strong>, and find their list stored locally when they <strong><em>refresh or revisit the page</em></strong>.

  <p>The project was an assignment for the <a href="https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926"><strong>University of Birmingham Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp</strong></a>. This version of the project, however, was built after finishing the course - in order to consolidate my knowledge about React. It was built with starter code - but most of the React logic itself is my own.</p>

## About
This project was a <strong>classroom assignment</strong> for the <strong>[University of Birmingham Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926)</strong>: a 24-week intensive coding bootcamp programme that aimed to teach us the full-range of skills required for <strong>front-end</strong>, <strong>back-end</strong> and <strong>React development</strong>. This project was assigned during <strong>Week 20</strong>, which covered <strong>the fundamentals of React</strong>.

The classroom assignments were tasks we were given in the third session of each week. Each of these tasks were based on a <strong><em>real world scenario</em></strong> and they would require us to <strong>apply the technology and critical concepts we had just learned</strong> in order to solve it. This task required us to put into practice <strong>every core feature of React</strong> we had learned so far: <strong><em>components</em></strong>, <strong><em>props</em></strong>, <strong><em>state</em></strong>, <strong><em>forms</em></strong> and <strong><em>event handling</em></strong>, <strong><em>conditional rendering</em></strong> and <strong><em>the useEffect hook</em></strong>. You can read the [brief for the project here](https://github.com/djbowen95/Hit-the-Bucket/blob/main/docs/BRIEF.md).

The project was built [from starter code](https://github.com/djbowen95/Hit-the-Bucket/releases/tag/0.0.0): however most of the essential React logic is mine. The key blocks of code that are required to make this application function are lines of code that I wrote. I have outlined the process I followed to meet the criteria set out in the brief, and how I used the core features React specifically to solve these problems, in the sections below.

## User Guide
With this application, you are able to:

- View the bucket list
- Add an item to the bucket
- Update an item in the bucket
- Remove an item from the bucket
- Mark an item as complete
- Set an eagerness level depending on how keen you are to get an item on your bucket complete
- Refresh the page, or navigate away and return, and find your bucket list where you left it

I will edit in with short demonstration GIFs of each of these features at a later date.

## Key Features
<strong>Hit the Bucket</strong> is built with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Its most complex features are built in React. These features include:

- Multiple React components, a component tree
- State objects to store different values
- Props, passing both static values, state objects, and state-altering functions between components
- Event handling and forms with React
- Conditional rendering, a component that is reused in more than one context using conditional elements
- Saving user data with localStorage
- Retrieving user data using the useEffect hook

I will edit in with a code snippet and explanation of where specifically in the project I used each of these things.

## Version History
### 0.3.0 Make user data persist using localStorage; deploy
### 0.2.0 Mark complete; remove; edit/update bucket items
### 0.1.0 Add bucket item; render bucket items
Please take a look at the notes I made here, they are very detailed!
### 0.0.0 Starter Code
