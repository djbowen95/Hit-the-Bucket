<h1 align="center"> üèñÔ∏è Hit the Bucket üèñÔ∏è </h1>

Bucket list application built with React. Multi-component application that stores user's bucket list in state; passes bucket list object and state modifying functions through props to different components. Built from starter code. 

Work in progress. I have been documenting this project as I've been building it. Please look at issues #1, #5 and #6 to see my progress so far (or release 0.1.0).

## About
This project is based on a mini-project for the [University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp](https://gist.github.com/djbowen95/2846640d520a16165b9b23db2d9e0926). It was a classroom project for Week 20, designed to put the fundamentals of React we had learned into practice.

## Key Features
The tech it uses includes:
- Multiple React components, a component tree
- State for storing an array
- Props, to pass through both the state object and functions that change state
- Event handling and forms
I think it will include more React features as I develop it futher - hopefully at least one hook (a useEffect hook), simple testing

## Version History
### 0.0.0 Starter Code
### 0.1.0 Add bucket item; render bucket items
Please take a look at the notes I made here, they are very detailed!
